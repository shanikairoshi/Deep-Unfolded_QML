# QML-and-Deep-Unfolded_QML

This repository includes the quantum machine learning implementations including 
- variational quantum classifiers (VQC), 
- Quantum Neural Network (QNN), 
- Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and 
- Pegasos Quantum Support Vector Classifier (PegasosQSVC).

Here we use qiskit based code and we introduce a novel implmentation of a deep unfolding to provide more interpretability to the optimization process for each of these qiskit algorithms.
